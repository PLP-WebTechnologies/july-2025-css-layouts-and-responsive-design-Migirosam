  <!-- Main Layout (Grid) -->

    <!-- Sidebar -->
    <aside class="sidebar">
      <h2>Sidebar</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to the sidebar! Here you can place important links, quick navigation tips, 
        or even small announcements. A sidebar works well for secondary information 
        that should be visible but not distracting from the main content. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might use this space for recent posts, popular articles, 
        or a list of categories that help readers discover more content on your site.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <!-- Main Content -->
    <section class="content">
      <h2>Main Content</h2>
      <p>
        This is the heart of the webpage. The main content area is where 
        you display your articles, blog posts, or product descriptions. 
        Using CSS Grid allows us to position this section flexibly alongside 
        the sidebar, while still adapting to smaller devices through media queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Responsive web design ensures that no matter the screen size—whether 
        on a large desktop monitor, a tablet, or a mobile phone—your layout 
        looks organized and easy to read. Flexible units like percentages and 
        `rem` values help create designs that scale naturally.
      </p>
      
      <!-- Flexbox Cards -->
      <div class="card-container">
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Card 1</h3>
          <p>
            This card demonstrates the use of Flexbox for equal spacing 
            and alignment. Cards like this are great for highlighting 
            products, services, or features. They adjust automatically 
            as the screen size changes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Card 2</h3>
          <p>
            Another example card. Notice how it maintains balance and 
            proportion. On smaller screens, these cards stack vertically 
            for better readability, thanks to the `flex-wrap` property 
            and responsive media queries.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Card 3</h3>
          <p>
            Cards can also contain images, buttons, or links. They 
            are one of the most versatile design patterns used in modern 
            web development, helping content remain both structured and 
            visually appealing.
